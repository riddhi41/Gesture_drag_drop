This project implements a gesture-controlled drag-and-drop system using OpenCV and cvzone's Hand Tracking Module. It enables users to interact with on-screen elements using hand gestures, making it accessible for individuals with disabilities.
It detects and tracks hands using MediaPipe-based HandDetector and 
identifies right and left hands accurately,
drag and drop UI elements using index finger gestures.
